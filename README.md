'flash' is a library offering utility functions for day to day ML and DS. This is by no means a replacement for libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, or sklearn. To use the utilities and function in this library, you should need a understanding of those libraries. If you find some areas where this library is lacking, feel free to do a PR. If you know how to write a good README, please consider raising a PR, since I am very bad at writing README files :(
